# Reconstruction Algorithms

## Most recent algorithms are contained in `pyreconstruct` folder.
`test.py` contains most up-to-date functions and test cases for the reconstruction and simulation algorithms. 
`sphere.py` details the code generating a uniform sphere of points
`functions.py` contains all functions for reconstruction and simulation. Use `test.py` for testing and other algorithms.
`n8p.py`, `a_12_1.py`, `sim.py` are all contained within `functions.py` and `test.py`.
